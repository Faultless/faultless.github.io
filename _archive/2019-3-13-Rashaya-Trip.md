### Chtoura

The trip kicked off at around 9am, once we were all gathered inside the bus. It took us as much as an hour and a half to reach our first mini-stop: Chtoura. There, we rested at a gun shop, which also happens to house one of the country's finest "sahlab", a deliciously sweet mixture of starch and cinnamon.

### Rashaya: The City

Once we were all saciated, we went on for another 30 minutes, reaching Rashaya by 11. There, our local guide Cheikh Ramzi awaited us, and escorted us to a nice village church.
At first, what really struck me was the examplary mixity between druz and christians, "living together" was as natural as breathing to them, a fine model for all of us to emulate. Coming back from the church, we met a local man raising 4 beautiful hunting dogs, majestic yet cute.

Walking through Rashaya's souk reminded me of Byblos, even though Rashaya felt more authentic, still clean of touristic shops and westernization.

### Rashaya: The Citadel

Next stop: The Citadel. This iconic monument, where the story of modern Lebanon was written in, did not disappoint; from the preserved captives' chambers, to the awe-inducing pictographic memories of past conflicts, everything inside felt genuinely lebanese.

### Snack before the ascension

Straight out of the citadel, we had a choice to make: going for a hike near Jabal El Sheikh right away, or pausing at a local Furn for each one to get a bite, sustaining us until we were done hiking. Taking everybody's input into account, we went for option 2.

### Jabal El Cheikh

The bus driver brought us halfway up one of the hills surrouding Mount Hermont. We were all feeling excitement building up, in anticipation of hiking in one of Lebanon's most preserved locations. The young ones raced to the top, while adults (with a few exceptions), paced themselves steadily.

The sun blessed us all the way, with a cool breeze keeping us refreshed.
At the top, the scenery made all of our efforts worth it: white mountain tops constrasting with the blooming hills around us.

A serie of photo-shooting sessions later, we made our way back down to the bus, as stomachs were starting to growl.
It was around 3 pm when we arrived at a nice local sandwich place; where we all had our fill of shawarma, grilled chicken, and other mouth-watering delicacies.

### The trip back

Around 4:30 pm, we were all feeling the weight of this long trip. Even so, we were all still eager to chat about the scenery passing us by. Between the colorful pastures of the Bekaa valley, and the snowey peaks on the way to dahr el bayday, our eyes could not settle for even a minute.

All in all, this trip was one to remember, and as we said our goodbyes, we were all anticipating the next one in May, further south.
