## The Tech

Let's talk briefly about my latest adult ADHD hyperfixation: NFC Tags. For a quick intro on what NFC is, [check here](https://www.androidauthority.com/nfc-tags-explained-271872/#:~:text=NFC%2C%20or%20near,various%20NFC%20tags.), but as a quick primer, we're talking about a simple technology that allows two NFC-compliant readers to send data to each other via a simple proximity "tap". It is so convenient for things like phone/watch payments and small file transfers, but that's not why I took interest in it today.

## Organisational issues

As a freshly 30 male learning how to Adult, it won't come as a surprise that my work/life/hobbies/whatever balance is very much out of whack: I have gadgets and everyday-use tools/items scattered in random places around a house I'm renting, to the point where I easily end up losing important documents or even my cards and passes just by virtue of the chaotic order I had setup in my brain and house was thrown the tiniest bit out by forgetting to replace said item in its exact old position. 

> The Random Chaotic Order works pretty well though, sadly..

In the adult world, this kind of approximated Order cannot fly. If I want to ever let another adult into my life, I have to get my life in order, figuratively but most importantly literally. There are a few cool systems out there for universal organization of items, physical or digital, and while I'm sure they do work for a lot of people, I am not "most people". I've learned the hard way that unless chores are gamified and made into a convenient bite-sized meal, the only way I would ever put in extra effort would be because of an over-engineered gimmick.

## Introducing: NFC Tags

This is where NFC Tags have a very appealing proposal in my view: through very basic scripting of smartphone tasks, you can place a bunch of small cheap pills in key locations of your house, which will each have their own script associated with recurring tasks in that specific location. For example, a Tag in the egg basket to start an egg boiling timer; or a tag under my work laptop that starts relaxing jazz music and mutes notifications. The possibilities are near-endless, and the whole thing is low-tech and simple enough to not introduce security risks IoT devices are most famous for.
