## Feels like 82

Everyone from my generation wants to masquerade as a 90s kid. Its cool to be a part of that wave of teenagers that grew up with prime playstation 1 games, prime cartoons, prime pokemon generation, prime World of Warcraft revolution, and not to forget the plethora of music in multiple edgy genres at the time.. All of this to say that me being born mid 90s, had no access to any of that subculture until half way through the 2000s, mostly just catching up on Animes from the golden eras: many of which left their mark on me forever.

## fabricated nostalgia

It shouldn't be a thing to feel nostalgia for a period you have not experienced at all, but being a clueless child discovering these shows as though they were brand new played to my advantage. I am and forever will be a sucker for shows like Nicky Larson and Cobra.
