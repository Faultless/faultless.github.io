## History

    As it were, and as are most things Japanese, the origins of Matcha are rooted in Chinese History. The concept of powdered tea was brought back to Japan in the eleven hundreds by a Buddhist Monk. Interestingly, he also infused the practice of Matcha preparation with its current ceremonial associations: Matcha was and still is a ritual one engages in as part of Zen practice.
    Naturally, in modern times, interest in powdered Matcha and the fascination for its ceremonial roots has paved the way for a worldwide exportation of the movement. Unfortunately, as things usually go with modern culture, Matcha came to the west as a Fad, something to spice your mocktails or lattes with.

## What I love about it

    I am by no means immune to those critiques. I myself indulge in a daily dose of Matcha Latte, though I do take the time to properly wisk and go through the process most professionals go through in order to enjoy a sliver of zen practice. In a daily life full of anxieties, an uncertain market, dictators in the whitehouse, its sometimes hard to take a step back and appreciate the little bubble of safety, the ephemeral connection to my environment and to fellow humans. Grounding oneself in a mundane, almost mechanical activity can be the difference between a life of brainrot, chasing the latest fad, and a life of inner peace, contentment even. Both light and darkness have a place in this world, order and chaos. And while the likes of Trump are agents of pure Chaos, it rests upon my own shoulders to bear the burden of establishing Order in my day to day Life. the Tea ceremony is but one avenue through which one can achieve such a thing.
