## Pushing 40

Its finally here, my thirties, and with them, a slew of health complications I could not have anticipated. For close to a decade, I had the priviledge of enjoying good health, fueled by my youth as well as religious fitness activity. I am sad to announce that those days are now gone; the back pain, the throat pain, and general weakness are all catching up to me now. No amount of minimum viable healthy eating habits and sleep will be the silver bullet to put me back on track. Its going to take a lot more careful consideration on my part. Starting with cleaner eating habits during my bulks, and making sure I maintain a clean environment that is habitable and breatheable, especially during winter season.

## Stagnation

It does feel every time I get even a minor health setback that all my efforts at the gym can be undone in a matter of days. But that's probably not the right way to look at things; after all, I've not seen a lot of progress when it comes to my physique over a period of several months at this point. Naturally, the period of weight cutting will be a much better visual indicator of gains and volume, and there is also the genetic factor of me storing all my fat in my face. This is reality, and I really just need to accept my limitations, embrace the few strength I've been gifted, and just straight up show up every single week consistently. At one point, good short practice on a schedule will yield some form of long term REAL results. In all aspects of life might I add.

And so just the same, I'll be taking care of my health to the best of my ability, mimicking my approach to hobbies and daily activities in so many domains already.

_Isn't there some pokemon that can heal this thing?_
