## You are Not

As a 21st century monkey brought up on crooked values and swimming in technocratic black holes, you may think that your identity is this never ending robot-like emotion farm, where taking a breather feels quasi-impossible.

Waking up from a nightmare that is the societal norm is akin to a complete wipe of a system. You don't get to keep drowning in brainrot while simultaneously come even close to rewire your overstimulated brain for good.

## A Mantra for Life

The good news is, you are not alone. Masters have for millenia already figured out a great cookbook to guide us towards discovering our true self, with none of the voodoo woowoo BS hollywood snakeoilsmen try to peddle: No, this journey and practice rely solely on how much YOU want this to happen. A simple mantra can go a long way: You, the real you, are not your thoughts, nor are you your feelings. You may arguably not even exist as you've been illuding yourself for all these years. The guy you've been sharing a body with for 3 decades has not had a chance to exist, and take part in shaping his own existence, outside of external interference and biased data.
