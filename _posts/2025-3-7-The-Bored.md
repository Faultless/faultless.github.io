## The undesired State

As our society edges further and further into technocratic rule, and as the internet in its many forms slowly erodes our time spent in the physical world, what was once a major part of daily life, namely Boredom, takes a step back; becoming the demonised state of existence, the thing to avoid at all cost.

The many benefits of such a dramatic shift of the Human condition have been explored to death; I aim in this passage to give a concise observation of my own rapport with the tech world, and how it has shapen me into the man I am today.

## Humble Beginnings 

As a kid, and even as a young teenager, my parents were really strict about not giving me access to technologies, namely a PC, phone, or console, primarily as they themselves never developed interest in any of it. This has had a dual effect on my upbringing: on one end, I was a brainless underdeveloped child with no access to the infinitude of knowledge on the open web, while also breeding this unquenched hunger for the "things I missed" or was kept out of.

For the better part of my 20s, all I knew was a brain state of constant anxiety and mental activity. Now, early in my 30s, it has only gotten worse, to the point of physical deterioration, as well as dreading the day ahead with its unsurmountable checklist feel.

Living alone as a wageoid naturally bred me into a consumer of feel-good content, cheap empty content that can help my mind drift the pain of solitude and anxiety of the day away. I do that on the daily, mind you, without a proper plan in sight to mend this broken relationship with my inner self.

## Walk through that door

There's a way out, but I'm the only one who can push that door open. I'm on the verge of giving up on myself, even as I know I havent even scratched the surface of spirituality, a path to mend my ways.

Things do not have to be this way. An alternative, a middle ground is possible if only I could take the pain of catching myself as a fall into another thought loop, or engaging in pacifying time-hole activities.
