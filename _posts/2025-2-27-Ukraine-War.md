## What I understood happened

I'm not exactly a geopolitician or even an amateur historian. What I do know, is that through mishandled diplomacy by a severely weakened Western Europe, and a rise in opportunistic fascism on the Russian side, tensions between the two blocks escalated to the point where an open invasion sounded like a great idea with substantial returns on investment expected by Putin and his kin.
Many analysists will do their best to point the mistakes of the west, going so far as to directly blame them for Russia's aggression, but that is forgetting just how bad of a comic book villain the USSR has been, and continues to be under Putin and his oligarchical structure. Westerners need to seriously revisit their classics, look back at the foundational values that made modern Europe possible in the first place, as well as a desired destination for a good life by the entirety of the middle-east and african continent at large.

## What's next for the world?

This war has set an irrepareably toxic precedent for all wannabe dictators and expansionist lunatics armed with nukes: as long as you pose a world-ending threat, You can bully, hell, even waltz in and TAKE neighboring smaller countries with little to no consequences. Better yet, you can weaponize western social media and flood the brains of billions of low IQ individuals, who will gladly go to war for you against their own interested. That will in turn make sure you get away with your crimes and even become a champion of the Anti-woke mob in said democratic countries.

I don't think there is a way out of this coming crumbling of the post WW2 world order. What comes next is a series of hard times, where my stock options will hit rock bottom, my meager savings' worth will plummet with continued unprecedented inflation and a weakening of the EuroZone, and generally speaking, my dreams of a peaceful first-world life in a democratic country are all but naught with raving right-wing lunatics taking over most of Europe, and a communist nuclear block to the East that will never see us as fellow human beings and trade partners.
