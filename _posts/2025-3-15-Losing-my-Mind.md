The jury is out, I am not a well-balanced individual capable of functioning at a normal level in a modern society. The even worse news is that, with the advent of AI and announced singularity, there is quite likely not enough time for me to "Catch up" and mend my ways.
To tell the truth, even these mediocre daily paragraphs devoid of research or any semblance of effort on my part are a waste of time, designed to help me tick a daily checkbox.

## Let Go of the fodder

From [a recent study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-025-04658-6) on high-performing university students in China, the following results were seen:

> The results indicated that mindfulness positively and significantly influence students’ SWB and academic performance. Furthermore, students’ subjective wellbeing partially mediates the relationship between mindfulness and academic performance.

This study strongly suggests to me that an effort emphacizing my meditative practice, alongside regular studying, would yield 2 or 3 folds the benefits of just rote memorization. When it comes to a test of endurance and performing under pressure that is the GMAT, no amount of classical training regime will land me a perfect score. It is only through complete mastery over stress, time-constraints and adaptive difficulty that I will be able to perform to my full potential, and make use of all the accumulated knowledge lodged in my brain.

## Let Loose

So Losing My Mind might actually entail more than just craziness or frivolty. This is about letting go of the dictate of feelings and emotions, the grip thoughts have over your every waking moment. At the end, the world is in no worse shape than it was during your childhood, so do not make it even worse on yourself.. Look at objective metrics of your own progress, use others as inspiration and not as a source of Envy. The World is not necessarily out there to get you, and you will find that a majority of people will be there to lift you up, as long as you show a willingness to return the favor.
