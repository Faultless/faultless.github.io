## A sense

As a young adult, I never thought to question why I was in a constant state of thinking, hopping from one anxiety and insecurity to the next. In hindsight its naturally very simple to blast my idiocy and ask better of myself. But in truth when your emotions overrun you there is no fighting back with a weak mind like mine. There is a foundational change in the hardware as well as the OS that are mandatory changes before you can even think about tackling deeply rooted insecurities and monkey-like reactions to environmental triggers.

## Where to begin

At the base of it all, this overvalued sense of self needs a good nerf: you cannot continue living as though society revolves around your person. Of course, it goes without saying that one should not neglect their own place in society, however, dialing that egocentrism to a hundred and maintaining it is an exercise in exhaustion and lack of Zen; that sweet feeling of bliss, contentment and harmony with the world. This is not some voodoo BS, to be clear. Scientists around the world will echo these observations even on empirical cold data levels.
