## Neanderthals

The year is 2030, labor shortage is plaguing the totality of First-World nations. Populist regimes and totalitarian neo-feudalism have taken over what used to be known as the "Free World", with inequalities reaching never-before seen heights between the truly wealthy and the middle class, now clearly poor.
In a last-ditch effort by privatised governments to forcefully keep market growth while the great replacement plan using AI is still being built, an elite task-force of brilliant genists and biologists have been tasked with reviving the long deceised Neanderthal; the reasoning being as follows:
- Although far-right ideologies have made it through the collective consciousness at this stage, it is still a tall order to convince your population that 70 hours work-week for little-to-no pay would be for their own good.
- The effort to embed xenophobia as well as the othering of anyone that does not look exactly like yourself has been a major success.
With those ideas in mind, raising a humanoid race of, for all intents and purposes, Aliens and enslaving them for the sake of market growth sounds like the perfect win-win scenario for billionaire shareholders across the globe.
