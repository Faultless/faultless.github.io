## Neanderthals

The year is 2030, labor shortage is plaguing the totality of First-World nations. Populist regimes and totalitarian neo-feudalism have taken over what used to be known as the "Free World", with inequalities reaching never-before seen heights between the truly wealthy and the middle class, now clearly poor.
In a last-ditch effort by privatised governments to forcefully keep market growth while the great replacement plan using AI is still being built, an elite task-force of brilliant genists and biologists have been tasked with reviving the long deceised Neanderthal; the reasoning being as follows:
- Although far-right ideologies have made it through the collective consciousness at this stage, it is still a tall order to convince your population that 70 hours work-week for little-to-no pay would be for their own good.
- The effort to embed xenophobia as well as the othering of anyone that does not look exactly like yourself has been a major success.

With those ideas in mind, raising a humanoid race of, for all intents and purposes, Aliens and enslaving them for the sake of market growth sounds like the perfect win-win scenario for billionaire shareholders across the globe.

## Retired Yakuza

Yousuke is what you would call an average senior Japanese citizen living in a quiet village outside of Kyoto. For such a man, even the relative tranquility and safety of Kyoto was not enough; his true home where he would live his latter part of a rambunctious life would be no other than a fishing village away from the growing invasion of tourists throughout Japanese cities. On a hot Japanese summer day, as is part of his routine, Yousuke wrapped up the remainder of his daily chores: a rusty shovel balanced against a wall built by his father all those years ago, freshly ploughed Earth that exhumes a small all too familiar to farmers, and a hunched over old man, feeling the weight of decades upon decades of intense labor. The sun was at its zenith when Yousuke, feeling dehydration slowly kicking, decided to take a stroll down towards the village square, where a modest market took over the village every Sunday. Today was no such day however, with the Square showing little signs of Life aside from the village NandemoYa handiman, Shuntaro, fixing the few spotlights that encircle the round square, which were starting to show their age. As the intensity of the heat mixed with his hatred for bamboo hats took their toll, Yousuke barely managed a curt "konnichiwa" before wavering in his walk down the square, and ended up collapsing headfirst at the foot of the stairs leading up to the village shrine.

# The Watch

The atomic clock struck midnight as Tyren walked past the dim lit cemetary of fallen Heroes of Mankind on his way to the watchtower. It had been 5 months since he and his squadron had been assigned to the protection of a captured humanoid city named Beliar. He could not for the life of him understand the reasoning for it: a town straight out of the earlier millenium, with more farms and taverns than barracks and modern structures.. Where was the steel, the neon-lit downtown areas, the cybernetically enhanced populace? All you could hope to find in this ditch were weak and powerless human lifeforms, going about their mindnumbing business with fear and hatred in their eyes for their captors. "What an uninspired lot of insects.." he mumbled as a group of drunkards swayed past him on their way to the next intoxication station. 

None of it made sense, was he and his men being punished for accomplishing their mission on this planet? Was it their fault if it ended up being a less-than-desireable vassal to the empirium of mankind? As he pondered these recurring questions in an quasi-systematic way, the watchtower came into view, as he rounded the town tavern.. It was completely dark, only visible thanks to the 2 moons casting their reflections on either side. Wasn't Bren supposed to light and tend to the system of torches at all times? As he was lost in thought analysing every possible scenario, a hollow, but loud thud resonated out of the tower. Tyren took out his chainsword and began to run.

Paradoxically, you could see more of the tower and its surroundings under the moonlight than usual, and Tyren could have sworn that the structure looked more imposing than usual. It was almost as if an Aura was emanating from it at a constant interval, straight out of a children's tale. With the entrance in sight, Tyren slowed his pace down to a halt, taking each step as stealthily as his Astartes armour allowed for.

As the adrenaline was being pumped harder and harder thanks to his 2 hearts, Tyren tried his best to regulate his breathing while forcing his way through the narrow entryway to the tower. Looking around, the old wooden planks making up the walls, and the stairway to the right looked the same as ever; and it wasn't until he turned his gaze upwards towards the spiraling staircase that the horrorshow began. Mouth agape, dangling form the railing like a puppet, Pyron, one of his most capable and trusted legionaires. Without giving himself the time to process what he just saw, Tyren vaulted the winding staircase 4 at as time, determined to get a handle on the situation and find what freak of nature had bested his men.

At the top of the tower, with the moonlight shining through glass panes, lied another of his comerades.. "Falton.. my brother.. how is this even possible?" He cried in disbelief. It was clear from a glance around the open empty deck that whomever had done all that was long gone by now. 

"Tyren.. is that you..?" a feeble voice startled Tyren as he was finishing his tour of the crime scene. "Falton! I'm here brother. Who did this to you?" His comerade looked as though he already had a foot in the grave, and could only answer with incoherent weak sounds: "The Villagers.. tyrannids.. shapeshifters.. I.. You must search... .. ." His face slowly lost its colors, and his armored hand slipped from its grip on Tyren's shoulder pad. The proud warrior Falton was now in the arms of the leader of Mankind. Tyren felt as though both of his enhanced hearts skipped a beat, as the reality of the loss of his closest brother started to sink in.

"This will not go unpunished." Tyren's blood was boiling as he stood up with his dead brother in his arms, after slowly walking down the spiraling staircase, he kicked down the door to the watchtower, and resolutely stomped his way to the townsquare, where the annual harvest festival was still in full swing: The smell of cheap beer from so many drunkards, laughter and shouting out of every caravan.. The Astartes could not bear to hear or see any of it. Not after what he had just seen and heard from his closest friend. These people that he'd been tasked with protecting, now looked like the source of Evil that he'd spent his life eradicating. After shoving his way to the center stage setup in the middle of the square, and earning himself quite a few confused glances and worried looks, Tyren got up on stage, and, looking the mayor squarely in the eye, dropped his fallen comerade's body before his very feet.

"Sir Astartes.. w-what is the meaning of this? Is that Sir Falton?? How can this be.. I-" "-Save it, little one. You and your breathren have a lot to answer for tonight. Whatever sick betrayal you've all come up with will come to light, and I WILL HAVE MY ANSWERS!" Not many creatures can brag to have remained unshaken when faced with the shouts of an angry Astartes, and our villagers were certainly not amongst their ranks.
