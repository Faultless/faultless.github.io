# The World

Shin-Utrecht: The worst has come to pass, and in the year 2030, the post world wars NWO experiment had failed. Through the act of populists, insatiable capitalists, and the metastizing of the all digital dystopian grooming of the world populace come to bear; the western model of democracy had failed. Its collapse was 10x the downfall of the USSR some 40 years earlier, and as such, not a single nation in europe and north america alike was left standing as a cohesive society. Chaos, martial law, looting, massacres were a daily occurence. The so-called "elected officials" were the product of that same school of greed and personal gain in place of public service. 
Out of the chaos and calamitous collapse of the western world, there were 2 beacons of hope, albeit minuscule when put against what had been. These 2 nations would end up creating, out of the ashes of the old world, and in spite of the totalitarian juggernauts surrounding them, a new way of living - nay, a whole other civilizational model, full of esoteric wonders to marvel at.

Japan and the Netherlands, at first glance, these two nations did not have much in common, historically or culturally. Surprisingly, the resilience of these 2 countries, born out of different hardships they had to struggle with, was a powerful catalyst for them banding together and emerging as a unified nation spread across the pacific ocean, from the Japanese archipelago to the innumerable pacific islands all the way to Hawaii. 

# Magic System

We've all read or were curious about magic as kids. Once adults, you learned to dismiss such ridiculous notions as super powers or spellcasting as nothing more than a nice hobby for nerds and YA novels to self-insert into. The saying goes, however, that any form of technology advanced enough would be indistinguishable from magic. While authocracies chose to weaponize scientific breakthroughs to enslave their constituants, gradually replace all of them with sophisticated algorithms and cyborgs to the benefits of oligarchs; Shinhopan decided to put all the advancements in tech. not in the hands of the military, but in the hands of its citizens: following the northern european model of decomplexed socialism, efforts were poored in on the governmental level in order to decentralize access to scientific processes and manufacturing, such that each micro and macro communities across the realm could spin up their own workshops and stores, subsidized by the "government" which acted more like a facilitator than a God. This was only possible through a 20 years gradual effort to eradicate ignorance, making sure each and every individual was accounted for in schools and raised to critically analyze their own thoughts, seeking and welcoming contradictions. Every person was hence an active member in their community, by virtue of which all the wrongs of late-stage capitalism were ironed out.
